  services may collect and process certain personal information on our behalf. By using our website, you acknowledge and
  agree that your data may be shared with the following third-party services:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS): We rely on AWS for hosting our website and utilizing several of their services to
    ensure a secure and efficient user experience. The AWS services we use include:
    <ol class="letters" type="a">
      <li>AWS Amplify: We leverage AWS Amplify to streamline the development and deployment of our web application.</li>
      <li>AWS Cognito: We utilize AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization. This service securely manages
        user account information, including the hashing of passwords, which ensures that nobody has access to your
        actual password.
      </li>
      <li>AWS DynamoDB: We utilize AWS DynamoDB to store certain user profile information such as the profile picture,
        email, full name, questions, answers, about me section, and username. DynamoDB helps us efficiently store and
        retrieve this information while ensuring scalability and data integrity.
      </li>
      <li>AWS Lambda: We use AWS Lambda to process users' questions and answers, and to compute various miscellaneous
        tasks. This service allows us to execute code in a scalable and efficient manner, enabling the processing and
        analysis of user-generated content.
      </li>
    </ol>
    For more information on how AWS collects and uses your data, refer to the AWS Privacy Notice.
  </li>
  <li>Google AdSense: We have implemented Google AdSense on our website to display advertisements. Google AdSense may
    collect certain information about your interactions with the ads, such as your IP address and browsing behavior, to
    provide personalized advertisements. Please refer to Google AdSense's privacy policy for more information on how
    they collect, use, and protect your data.
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="paragraph">Please note that while we have reputable third-party service providers, we do not have direct
  control over their data practices. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services to
  understand how they handle and protect your personal information.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Retaining Your Data</p>
<p class="paragraph">We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
  privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The specific duration for which we retain your data depends on the type of information and the
  purposes for which it was collected. We will retain your data as long as it is necessary to provide you with access to
  our services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p class="paragraph">If you no longer wish to have your personal data held by us, please refer to the "Contact
  Information" section to request the deletion of your account and associated data. However, please note that certain
  data may be retained as required by law or for legitimate business purposes, such as backup copies or to prevent fraud
  or abuse.</p>
<p class="paragraph">We take appropriate measures to ensure the security and integrity of your personal data during the
  retention period. This includes implementing industry-standard security measures to protect against unauthorized
  access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your personal information.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Keeping Your Data Secure</p>
<p class="paragraph">We take the security of your personal data seriously and implement appropriate technical and
  organizational measures to protect it. We have implemented several precautions designed to prevent unauthorized
  access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your personal information.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Here are some of the measures we have in place to keep your data secure:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Encryption: We utilize AWS Cognito to manage and store passwords, which uses encryption techniques such as secure
    socket layer (SSL) technology, to protect the transmission of data between your device and our website. This helps
    ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information during transit. Additionally, all passwords
    are hashed before storing, which means nobody has access to the actual password.
  </li>
  <li>Data Minimization: We only collect and retain the personal data that is necessary for the purposes outlined in
    this privacy policy. No additional data is collected for marketing purposes.
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="paragraph">While we strive to implement and maintain robust security measures, no method of transmission or
  storage can guarantee absolute security. However, we continuously monitor and update our security practices to protect
  your personal information to the best of our abilities.
</p>
<p class="subtitle">Children's Privacy</p>
<p class="paragraph">Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. While our website is accessible to users of
  all ages, including children under the age of 13, we do not treat children differently than other users in terms of
  data collection and handling. This is because no data we collect can be used to harm children specifically.</p>
<p class="paragraph">If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information on
  our website without your consent, please contact us immediately using the information provided in the "Contact
  Information" section. We will take prompt steps to delete the information from our systems.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Updates to Our Privacy Policy</p>
<p class="paragraph">We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data practices, legal
  requirements, or industry standards. We encourage you to periodically review this policy for any updates.</p>
<p class="paragraph">When we make any material changes to this privacy policy, we will notify you by email or by
  prominently posting a notice on our website prior to the changes taking effect. We will also seek your consent for any
  significant changes if required by applicable laws.</p>
<p class="paragraph">By continuing to use our website after the effective date of the updated privacy policy, you
  indicate your acceptance of the revised terms. If you do not agree with the terms of the updated privacy policy,
  please discontinue using our website and contact us if you would like us to delete your personal information.</p>
<p class="paragraph">It is your responsibility to ensure that we have your current and valid email address, and to
  periodically check for any updates or changes to this privacy policy.</p>

  your personal information, please use the "Contact Us" page on our website. This page provides a convenient and secure
